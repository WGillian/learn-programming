# Redux Tasks

[Start from React Seed](./cloneReactSeedInstructions.md)

Take a look at [our example and how we do things](https://github.com/z-dev/react-seed/blob/master/src/containers/todoList/index.js). We expect your answers to use the same style / techniques and pass a lint via CircleCi build.

* Recreate the [jQuery Cat site](https://github.com/z-dev/hacker-how-content/blob/master/content/web-developer/courses/core/jquery.md) using React. 
  * You should use redux for all state (so no `this.state`). 
  * Your answer should display when you visit http://localhost:3000/cats
  * Create a new `cats.js` reducer and `cats.js` action and container.
* Convert the TodoList example in React Seed to use 100% redux-thunk. 
* Load the albums of Kate Bush into redux state and onto the screen [Spotify API to load the albums of Kate Bush](https://gist.github.com/richardgill/c452bea70840652110831fde95c695bd)
