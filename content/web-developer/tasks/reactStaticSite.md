# React Static Site

You will be building a static site using React. 

* Site should be static (non-interactive, no clicking etc.)
* Quite simple
* Have some repeated bits in it (e.g. Front Page of reddit has a lot of repition, each post is rendered the same).
* Styling can be very poor

1. 

Draw, sketch, make in a word or screenshot a website you want to make.

Draw boxes around parts you think will be components.

Share this with us.

2. 

Go build it. And submit PRs which are less than 6 screens of diff high so we can review your work / progress.
