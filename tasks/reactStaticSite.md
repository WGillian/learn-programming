# React Static Site

You will be building a static site using React. 

* Site should be static (non-interactive, no clicking etc.)
* Quite simple
* Have some repeated bits in it (e.g. Front Page of reddit has a lot of repition, each post is rendered the same).
* Styling can be very poor

1. 

* Draw, sketch, make in a word or screenshot a website you want to make.

* Draw boxes around parts you think will be components.

* **Share this with us.**

2.

[Setup your project in a fresh repo](./cloneReactSeedInstructions.md)

Go build it. 

Setup a build on circleci for your project: https://circleci.com/docs/1.0/getting-started/ (The build should pass before you send us a PR)

And submit PRs which are less than 6 screens of diff high so we can review your work / progress.
